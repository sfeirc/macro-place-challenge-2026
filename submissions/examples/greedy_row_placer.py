"""
Greedy Row Placer - Demo Submission

A simple but legal placer that:
1. Sorts macros by height (tallest first)
2. Places them left-to-right in rows (like shelf packing)
3. Guarantees zero overlaps and canvas boundary compliance

This produces valid, scoreable placements but makes no attempt to
optimize wirelength, density, or congestion. Use it as a starting
point for your own algorithm.

Usage:
    uv run evaluate submissions/examples/greedy_row_placer.py
    uv run evaluate submissions/examples/greedy_row_placer.py --all
    uv run evaluate submissions/examples/greedy_row_placer.py -b ibm03
